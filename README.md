====================

What's that Skip? You're an IRC bot? GREAT...

## Roadmap
* Print URL titles into channel
* <faulteh> actually have a practical taslug bot idea... the bot scrapes all url's pasted into the channel that can be recalled in a list that i can go through later and add as news items for the monthly slides :)
* <faulteh> and an in-channel apt-cache search feature :)
* <faulteh> most important feature... the bot needs to respond to sudo :)
