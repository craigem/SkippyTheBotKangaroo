====================

What's that Skip? You're an IRC bot? GREAT...

* Now logs into IRC
* Scrapes URLs  and prints the title into the channel.

## Roadmap
* Add some error handling.
* **faulteh** actually have a practical taslug bot idea... the bot scrapes all url's pasted into the channel that can be recalled in a list that i can go through later and add as news items for the monthly slides :)
* **faulteh** and an in-channel apt-cache search feature :)
* **faulteh** most important feature... the bot needs to respond to sudo :)
